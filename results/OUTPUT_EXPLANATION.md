# TRELLIS Local Editing Output Files

## Overview
This document explains the various output files generated by the TRELLIS local editing pipeline when running `example_local_edit.py`.

## Output Files

### 1. **edited.glb** - Final Edited 3D Model
- The main output file containing the locally edited 3D mesh
- GLB format (binary glTF) that includes geometry, materials, and textures
- Can be viewed in any 3D viewer, imported into game engines, or used in 3D applications
- Generated from the radiance field and mesh outputs after postprocessing

### 2. **sample_gs.mp4** - Gaussian Splatting Render
- A 360° rotating video showing the edited object rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting
- Provides a smooth, high-quality visualization with view-dependent effects
- Best for showing fine details and realistic appearance
- Generated at line 268-271 in example_local_edit.py

### 3. **sample_rf.mp4** - Radiance Field Render  
- A 360° rotating video showing the edited object rendered as a neural radiance field
- Shows the volumetric representation before mesh extraction
- Good for demonstrating the intermediate representation quality
- Generated at line 272-277 in example_local_edit.py

### 4. **sample_mesh.mp4** - Mesh Normal Render
- A 360° rotating video showing the surface normals of the extracted mesh
- Displays geometric details without textures (normals visualized as colors)
- Useful for evaluating the quality of the mesh topology and surface smoothness
- Generated at line 278-281 in example_local_edit.py

### 5. **latents/ss.npz** - Sparse Structure Latent
- NumPy archive containing the sparse structure representation
- Encodes the overall 3D shape and structure at low resolution (16³ voxels)
- Can be reused for further editing or analysis
- Generated at line 257-260 in example_local_edit.py

### 6. **latents/slat.npz** - Structured Latent (SLAT)
- NumPy archive containing coordinates and features for the structured latent
- Higher resolution representation that captures fine details
- Contains both spatial coordinates and learned features
- Generated at line 261-265 in example_local_edit.py

## Directory Structure
Each experiment creates a subdirectory named with its parameters:
```
cfg_[ss_cfg]_[slat_cfg]_resample[times]_steps[num]/
├── edited.glb           # Final edited mesh
├── sample_gs.mp4        # Gaussian splatting render
├── sample_rf.mp4        # Radiance field render
├── sample_mesh.mp4      # Mesh normal render
└── latents/
    ├── ss.npz           # Sparse structure
    └── slat.npz         # Structured latent
```

## Parameter Meanings
- **cfg_X.X_Y.Y**: Classifier-free guidance strengths (ss_cfg, slat_cfg)
- **resampleN**: Number of resampling iterations for denoising
- **stepsN**: Number of diffusion steps

## Demo Presentation Suggestions

### 1. Before/After Comparison
- Show original mesh (from assets) vs edited.glb side-by-side
- Highlight the specific region that was edited with the mask

### 2. Video Renders
- Play sample_gs.mp4 for the most visually appealing result
- Show sample_mesh.mp4 to demonstrate geometric quality
- Optionally show sample_rf.mp4 for technical audiences

### 3. Parameter Variations
- Compare results across different cfg values (5.0 vs 7.5)
- Show effect of resample times (1 vs 3 vs 5)
- Demonstrate quality vs speed tradeoff (12 vs 25 steps)

### 4. Interactive 3D Viewing
- Load edited.glb in a web-based 3D viewer for interactive exploration
- Allow rotation, zoom, and inspection of edited regions
- Tools like model-viewer.dev or three.js viewers work well

## Best Practices for Demos
1. Start with the highest quality result (typically cfg_7.5_5.0_resample3_steps25)
2. Show the reference image used for editing alongside results
3. Highlight the mask region to show where edits were applied
4. Use sample_gs.mp4 for visual impact, edited.glb for interaction
